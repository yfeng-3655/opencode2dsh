/**
 * Settings-controller resolution for the browser half.
 *
 * DSH renamed BOTH the settings service and the plugin-page slot across
 * releases, and the two services address a namespace differently:
 *
 *  - `settingsScope.bind({ namespace })` (DSH <= 0.1.6) hands back a controller
 *    over a namespace the Host plugin REGISTERED — already section-shaped, so
 *    the card consumes it directly.
 *  - `configForms.get(entryId)` (DSH >= 0.1.7) hands back the profile ENTRY's
 *    own form: the plugin's whole `Config`, addressed by the profile entry id.
 *    The ip-pool knobs therefore sit one level down at `ipPool`.
 *
 * This module keeps that difference in one place and returns the flat,
 * section-shaped controller the card was written against. It is pure (a
 * context in, a controller or undefined out) so it can be unit-tested without
 * a browser, which matters because the failure mode it guards against —
 * declaring a service the host does not provide — parks the ENTIRE client half
 * in `pending (waiting for service: …)`.

/**

 *  1. `configForms.get(ENTRY_ID)` — the >= 0.1.7 profile-ENTRY form. Only hits

 *  3. `settings.bind({ namespace })` — the 0.1.7+ name of that same domain.
 *
 * [host-compat patch] The attempts are a FALLBACK CHAIN, not a mutually
 * exclusive switch. They used to be exclusive on the theory that "the two
 * services identify the addressing scheme", which made a `configForms` service
 * that does not carry this plugin's entry form a DEAD END: on a
 * `dsh plugin add` install the plugin is not a managed profile entry, so
 * `configForms.get('opencode2dsh')` returns undefined, the resolver answered
 * undefined, and the settings card silently vanished — while the two
 * namespace-bound services right behind it would have worked. A miss now
 * costs one attempt, never the whole chain.
 *
 * Returns undefined only when no era resolves, which costs the settings card
 * alone — model routing is unaffected.
